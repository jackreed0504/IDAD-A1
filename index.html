        <h3>Information Design</h3>

        <p>
          Sequencer 01 uses minimal labels, encouraging experimentation: the
          “pitch” control lacks a unit of measurement. There are no instructions
          or descriptions of what each control does. The contrast of green
          against black and white distinguishes controls, buttons and the
          playhead from other elements. Line is used to separate groups of
          related elements, such as the header, clock and transforms.
        </p>

        <p class>
          Holdspace also uses a minimal interface. It gives users some
          instruction in the form of text, which eventually disappears. This
          encourages exploration and play. An animated graphic mirrors the
          sound, helping deliver the aural information. The 3D polygonal shapes
          in the graphic evoke futuristic, technological themes, reinforcing the
          experimental electronic music. White space and contrast between black
          and white draw the user to the text instructions and the graphics. A
          progress bar at the top of the screen goes forwards when the space bar
          is held down, and otherwise goes backwards.
        </p>

        <p class>
          While Sequencer 01 and Holdspace are vastly different types of
          experiences, they both use minimalistic information design to invite
          play and experimentation from the viewer. However, as Sequencer 01 is
          a more traditional audio tool, it features more detailed information
          than Holdspace, an interactive music piece.
        </p>

        <h3>Mapping</h3>

        <p>
          Many of the controls in Sequencer 01 are mapped to potentiometers,
          including Pattern, Pitch and Sound. The use of potentiometers in
          contrast to options such as dropdowns encourages the user to
          experiment with different options. Reinforcing this, controls such as
          pitch and shape lack a unit of measurement, prompting the user to
          experiment rather than to seek precision. There is a 16-step grid
          sequencer allowing users to manually program sounds, as well as
          potentiometers for patterns, and randomise, flip, wander and rebound
          buttons to encourage play.
        </p>

        <p>
          By contrast, Holdspace uses a single control, the space bar, to allow
          the user to interact with the song and graphic. The sound and visuals
          change depending on whether the space bar is held down.
        </p>

        <img
          src="assets/hold.png"
          alt="Holdspace when Space Engages"
          class="holdspace"
        />
        <img
          src="assets/holdalt.png"
          alt="Holdspace when Space Released"
          class="holdspace"
        />

        <p>
          Sequencer 01 gives the plently of interactivity and control via user
          extensive mapping, giving them experience of a traditional sequencer.
          By contrast, Holdspace’s single control aims to add a small dimension
          of interactivity and control into the music piece.
        </p>

        <h3>Characterisation</h3>

        <p>
          Sequencer 01’s minimalist monochromatic, design is engineered mainly
          to communicate the device’s functions, presenting it as an audio tool.
          The use of a monospaced font evokes aesthetics associated with
          technology and code, reminding the user that this is an experimental
          digital media project. The tool’s experimental nature is also
          expressed through a playful, bright green colour (other tools in the
          Intersymmetric Works series feature bright pink and blue), inviting
          the user to play around with the tool.
        </p>

        <p>
          Holdspace instructs the user via basic instructions in an unobtrusive,
          basic sans serif font. The decision for all the text to be lowercase
          makes the instructions sound unauthoritative and calm.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/instruction.png" alt="Holdspace Instructions" />
        <p>
          These choices invite the user into the experience, without distracting
          from the media being presented. The visuals of wireframe, polygonal 3D
          shapes, evoke themes of technology and the future. The experimental
          electronic soundtrack also evokes these themes. This invites the user
          to approach Holdspace with curiosity, characterising it as an
          experimental experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sequencer 01 and Holdspace both use characterisation to express their
          experimental nature but in different ways, with Sequencer 01’s use of
          a monospaced font and playful colours, in contrast to Holdspace’s use
          of futuristic visuals.
        </p>

        <h3>Feedback</h3>

        <p>
          Sequencer 01’s buttons change colour upon hovering, and all change
          colour when engaged except for the play button, which changes to a
          pause symbol. In addition, the potentiometers change colour while
          being pressed. In the sequencer grid, when steps are pressed, an X is
          placed to denote that a sound will play on that beat. While the
          sequence is playing, a column on the grid represents a play head,
          providing feedback for the musical output. This helps create a tactile
          experience for the user, who would benefit from clear feedback for
          their actions in an audio tool. In addition, the tactile buttons
          replicate physical devices such as sequencers, which would use
          physical buttons which provide tactile feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
          Holdspace features a loading screen with a percentage showing the
          loading progress. This signals to the viewer that the site may take a
          long duration to load and gives detailed feedback as to how it is
          progressing.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/loading.png" alt="Holdspace Loading Screen" />
        <p>
          The music and animation changes depending on whether the space bar is
          held down and becomes more intense over the duration on the space bar
          being pressed. This feedback is used to create an interactive way to
          experience the music and visuals. The progress bar at the top of the
          screen demonstrates to the user how far they are into the duration of
          the work, but with its ability to go backwards, also adds a unique
          dimension into the experience of consuming time-based media.
        </p>

        <p>
          As Sequencer 01 and Holdspace are both time-based and musical, they
          both provide feedback related to duration, with Sequencer 01’s
          playhead and Holdspace’s progress bar. Holdspace’s progress bar’s
          property to move backwards or forwards, and Sequencer 01’s playhead’s
          ability to “wander” and “rebound” highlight the experimental
          interactions of each site. Holdspace’s minimal feedback in contrast to
          the many different button animations and other feedback in Sequencer
          01 highlights the different purposes of Holdspace as an interactive
          music piece and Sequencer 01 as an audio toy. This is also reflected
          in Sequencer 01’s traditional play button behaviour wherein you press
          play once and the sequence plays. In contrast, Holdspace requires the
          user to hold space continually to make one audio piece and animation
          play, and keep it released to play a different audio piece and
          animation. This reinforces the interactive component of the
          interactive music piece.
