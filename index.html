        <h3>Information Design</h3>

        <p>
          Sequencer 01 uses minimal labels, encouraging experimentation: the
          “pitch” control lacks a unit of measurement There are no instructions
          or descriptions of what each control does. The contrast of green
          against black and white distinguishes controls, buttons and the
          playhead from other elements. Line is used to separate groups of
          related elements, such as the header, clock and transforms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Holdspace also uses a minimal interface. It gives users some
          instruction in the form of text, which eventually disappears. This
          encourages exploration and play. An animated graphic mirrors the
          sound, helping deliver the aural information. White space and contrast
          between black and white draw the user to the text instructions and the
          graphics. A progress bar at the top of the screen goes forwards when
          the space bar is held down, and otherwise goes backwards.
        </p>

        <h3>Mapping</h3>

        <p>
          Many of the controls in Sequencer 01 are mapped to potentiometers,
          including Pattern, Pitch and Sound. The use of potentiometers in
          contrast to options such as dropdowns encourages the user to
          experiment with different options. Reinforcing this, controls such as
          pitch and shape lack a unit of measurement, prompting the user to
          experiment rather than to seek precision. There is a 16-step grid
          sequencer allowing users to manually program sounds, as well as
          potentiometers for patterns, and randomise, flip, wander and rebound
          buttons to encourage play.
        </p>

        <p>
          By contrast, Holdspace uses a single control, the space bar, to allow
          the user to interact with the song and graphic. The sound and visuals
          change depending on whether the space bar is held down.
